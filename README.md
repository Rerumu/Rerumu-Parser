# Userdata Parser

Reason to it? None really. It's just better than JSON when used with ROBLOX datastores.
The parser returns a function to be called and used as follows.

```Lua
local Parsed = Parser(Method_Name, Data_Passed);
```

This is one of my older projects which has been sitting around in my directory for a while so the style will differ.
That's really about all there is to it. Source made by me.
